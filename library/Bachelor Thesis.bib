  abstract = {Accuracy and precision are two measures of observational error. Accuracy is how close a given set of measurements (observations or readings) are to their true value. Precision is how close the measurements are to each other. In other words: Precision is a description of random errors (a measure of statistical variability). Accuracy has two definitions, per ISO: More commonly, a description of systematic errors (a measure of statistical bias of a given measure of central tendency). Low accuracy causes a difference between a result and a true value. This secondary measure is referred to as trueness by ISO. A combination of both types of observational error (random and systematic), so high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness. In the first, more common definition of "accuracy" above, the concept is independent of "precision", so a particular set of data can be said to be accurate, precise, both, or neither. In simpler terms, given a statistical sample or set of data points from repeated measurements of the same quantity, the sample or set can be said to be accurate if their average is close to the true value of the quantity being measured, while the set can be said to be precise if their standard deviation is relatively small.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new representation and feature extraction method for biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93\%{\textpm}0.06\% is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8\% accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0\% accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about protein structure can be determined. Importantly, this model needs to be trained only once and can then be applied to extract a comprehensive set of information regarding proteins of interest. Moreover, this representation can be considered as pre-training for various applications of deep learning in bioinformatics.

We used enzymatic activity of chloroperoxidase on the metabolism of some phosphorothioate pesticides published previously and molecular mechanics methods to perform a theoretical approach of the mechanism of biological oxidation of this class of pesticides. The molecular structure of eight pesticides were optimized by molecular mechanics methods using the CAChe program package for biomolecules, ver. 3.11 (Oxford Molecular Ltd., Campbell, CA). Total energy resulted from the structure optimization process and the partial charges of both phosphorus and sulfur were computed for every pesticide. Phosphorus partial charge and enzymatic activity were significantly related by linear regression analysis (r=0.82, P{$<$}0.05). Analyzing our results and using previously reported enzymatic activity of chloroperoxidase on these pesticides, we deduced chemical events involved in activation of the active site of chloroperoxidase and proposed a novel mechanism of oxidation for this class of pesticides. This mechanism will also help to understand the oxidation process of pesticides by cytochrome P450, and production of toxic metabolites.}

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Enzyme-mediated bioremediation is divided into phase I and phase II, where the former increases the solubility of pesticide compounds through oxidation--reduction and hydrolysis reactions, while the latter transforms toxic pollutants into less toxic or nontoxic products through conjugation reactions. The identified enzymes that can degrade OC insecticides include dehalogenases, phenol hydroxylase, and laccases. Recent developments to improve enzyme-mediated bioremediation include immobilization, encapsulation, and protein engineering, which ensure its stability, recyclability, handling and storage, and better control of the reaction.},

  abstract = {BackgroundSelection of relevant genes for sample classification is a common task in most gene expression studies, where researchers try to identify the smallest possible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance (for instance, for future use with diagnostic purposes in clinical practice). Many gene selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene) rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds to select the number of genes, can only be applied to two-class problems, and use gene selection ranking criteria unrelated to the classification algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a classification algorithm well suited for microarray data: it shows excellent performance even when most predictive variables are noise, can be used when the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations and in problems involving more than two classes, and returns measures of variable importance. Thus, it is important to understand the performance of random forest with microarray data and its possible use for gene selection.ResultsWe investigate the use of random forest for classification of microarray data (including multi-class problems) and propose a new method of gene selection in classification problems based on random forest. Using simulated and nine microarray data sets we show that random forest has comparable performance to other classification methods, including DLDA, KNN, and SVM, and that the new gene selection procedure yields very small sets of genes (often smaller than alternative methods) while preserving predictive accuracy.ConclusionBecause of its performance and features, random forest and gene selection using random forest should probably become part of the "standard tool-box" of methods for class prediction and gene selection with microarray data.},

Recent breakthrough results in image analysis and speech recognition have generated a massive interest in this field because also applications in many other domains providing big data seem possible. On a downside, the mathematical and computational methodology underlying deep learning models is very challenging, especially for interdisciplinary scientists. For this reason, we present in this paper an introductory review of deep learning approaches including Deep Feedforward Neural Networks (D-FFNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Autoencoders (AEs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models form the major core architectures of deep learning models currently used and should belong in any data scientist's toolbox. Importantly, those core architectural building blocks can be composed flexibly---in an almost Lego-like manner---to build new application-specific network architectures. Hence, a basic understanding of these network architectures is important to be prepared for future developments in AI.},

Here the enzymatic degradation of diazinon (DIN) and diazoxon (DON), characterized by PS and PO, respectively, have been investigated by QM/MM calculations and MM MD simulations. Our calculations demonstrate that the hydrolysis of DON (with PO) is inevitably initiated by the nucleophilic attack of the bridging-OH- on the phosphorus center, while for DIN (with PS), we proposed a new degradation mechanism, initiated by the nucleophilic attack of the Zn{$\alpha$}-bound water molecule, for its low-energy pathway. For both DIN and DON, the hydrolytic reaction is predicted to be the rate-limiting step, with energy barriers of 18.5 and 17.7 kcal mol-1, respectively. The transportation of substrates to the active site, the release of the leaving group and the degraded product are generally verified to be favorable by MD simulations via umbrella sampling, both thermodynamically and dynamically. The side-chain residues Phe132, Leu271 and Tyr309 play the gate-switching role to manipulate substrate delivery and product release. In comparison with the DON-enzyme system, the degraded product of DIN is more easily released from the active site. These new findings will contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the enzymatic degradation of toxic organophosphorus compounds by PTE.}

However, the time and resource required make it prohibitively expensive to experimentally determine the function of every enzyme. Therefore, computational enzyme function prediction has become increasingly important. In this paper, we develop such an approach, determining the enzyme function by predicting the Enzyme Commission number. Results We propose an end-to-end feature selection and classification model training approach, as well as an automatic and robust feature dimensionality uniformization method, DEEPre, in the field of enzyme function prediction. Instead of extracting manually crafted features from enzyme sequences, our model takes the raw sequence encoding as inputs, extracting convolutional and sequential features from the raw encoding based on the classification result to directly improve the prediction performance. The thorough cross-fold validation experiments conducted on two large-scale datasets show that DEEPre improves the prediction performance over the previous state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our server outperforms five other servers in determining the main class of enzymes on a separate low-homology dataset.

However, understanding why certain models perform better than others or how one model learns differently than another is often difficult yet critical for increasing their effectiveness, improving prediction accuracy, and enabling fairness. Traditional methods for comparing models' efficacy, such as accuracy, precision, and recall provide a quantitative view of performance; however, the qualitative intricacies of why one model performs better than another are hidden. In this paper, we interview machine learning practitioners to understand their evaluation and comparison workflow. From there, we iteratively design a visual analytic approach, DeepCompare, to systematically compare the results of deep learning models, in order to provide insight into the model behavior and interactively assess tradeoffs between two such models. The tool allows users to evaluate model results, identify and compare activation patterns for misclassifications, and link the test results back to specific neurons. We conduct a preliminary evaluation through two real-world case studies to show that experts can make more informed decisions about the effectiveness of different types of models, understand in more detail the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and holistically evaluate the behavior of the models.}

  abstract = {In pattern recognition, information retrieval, object detection and classification (machine learning), precision and recall are performance metrics that apply to data retrieved from a collection, corpus or sample space. Precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances. Written as a formula: Recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that were retrieved. Written as a formula: Both precision and recall are therefore based on relevance.  Consider a computer program for recognizing dogs (the relevant element) in a digital photograph. Upon processing a picture which contains ten cats and twelve dogs, the program identifies eight dogs. Of the eight elements identified as dogs, only five actually are dogs (true positives), while the other three are cats (false positives). Seven dogs were missed (false negatives), and seven cats were correctly excluded (true negatives). The program's precision is then 5/8 (true positives / selected elements) while its recall is 5/12 (true positives / relevant elements). Adopting a hypothesis-testing approach from statistics, in which, in this case, the null hypothesis is that a given item is irrelevant (i.e., not a dog), absence of type I and type II errors (i.e., perfect specificity and sensitivity of 100\% each) corresponds respectively to perfect precision (no false positive) and perfect recall (no false negative).   More generally, recall is simply the complement of the type II error rate (i.e., one minus the type II error rate). Precision is related to the type I error rate, but in a slightly more complicated way, as it also depends upon the prior distribution of seeing a relevant vs. an irrelevant item. The above cat and dog example contained 8 - 5 = 3 type I errors (false positives) out of 10 total cats (true negatives), for a type I error rate of 3/10, and 12 - 5 = 7 type II errors (false negatives), for a type II error rate of 7/12.  Precision can be seen as a measure of quality, and recall as a measure of quantity.  Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones, and high recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned).},

  abstract = {A receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier model (can be used for multi class classification as well) at varying threshold values. The ROC curve is the plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at each threshold setting. The ROC can also be thought of as a plot of the statistical power as a function of the Type I Error of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity or recall as a function of false positive rate. Given the probability distributions for both true positive and false positive are known, the ROC curve is obtained as the cumulative distribution function (CDF, area under the probability distribution from                         -         {$\infty$}                 \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle -{\textbackslash}infty \}     to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the CDF of the false positive probability on the x-axis. ROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making.},

  abstract = {Synthetic organophosphorus compounds are used as pesticides, plasticizers, air fuel ingredients and chemical warfare agents. Organophosphorus compounds are the most widely used insecticides, accounting for an estimated 34\% of world-wide insecticide sales. Contamination of soil from pesticides as a result of their bulk handling at the farmyard or following application in the field or accidental release may lead occasionally to contamination of surface and ground water. Several reports suggest that a wide range of water and terrestrial ecosystems may be contaminated with organophosphorus compounds. These compounds possess high mammalian toxicity and it is therefore essential to remove them from the environments. In addition, about 200 000 metric tons of nerve (chemical warfare) agents have to be destroyed world-wide under Chemical Weapons Convention (1993). Bioremediation can offer an efficient and cheap option for decontamination of polluted ecosystems and destruction of nerve agents. The first micro-organism that could degrade organophosphorus compounds was isolated in 1973 and identified as Flavobacterium sp. Since then several bacterial and a few fungal species have been isolated which can degrade a wide range of organophosphorus compounds in liquid cultures and soil systems. The biochemistry of organophosphorus compound degradation by most of the bacteria seems to be identical, in which a structurally similar enzyme called organophosphate hydrolase or phosphotriesterase catalyzes the first step of the degradation. organophosphate hydrolase encoding gene opd (organophosphate degrading) gene has been isolated from geographically different regions and taxonomically different species. This gene has been sequenced, cloned in different organisms, and altered for better activity and stability. Recently, genes with similar function but different sequences have also been isolated and characterized. Engineered microorganisms have been tested for their ability to degrade different organophosphorus pollutants, including nerve agents. In this article, we review and propose pathways for degradation of some organophosphorus compounds by microorganisms. Isolation, characterization, utilization and manipulation of the major detoxifying enzymes and the molecular basis of degradation are discussed. The major achievements and technological advancements towards bioremediation of organophosphorus compounds, limitations of available technologies and future challenge are also discussed.},

We have adopted new methods of assessing proteome completeness and quality. We continue to extract detailed annotations from the literature to add to reviewed entries and supplement these in unreviewed entries with annotations provided by automated systems such as the newly implemented Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA). We have developed a credit-based publication submission interface to allow the community to contribute publications and annotations to UniProt entries. We describe how UniProtKB responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through expert curation of relevant entries that were rapidly made available to the research community through a dedicated portal.

  abstract = {Abstract A new approach for virtual characterization of the active site structure of enzymes with unknown three-dimensional (3D) structure has been proposed. It includes analysis of data on enzyme interaction with reversible competitive inhibitors, their 3D structures and moulding of the substrate-binding region. The superposition of ligands in biologically active conformations allows to determine the shape and dimension of the active site cavity accommodating these compounds. Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), a ``typical'' enzyme with unknown spatial organisation, was used to test this method. The correctness of such approach was validated by the analysis of HIV protease interaction with its inhibitors using 3D structures of their complexes. Mould of the substrate/inhibitor binding site can be used for the visualization of this binding site and for searching new ligands in molecular databases.},

  abstract = {Prediction of the spatial structure or function of biological macromolecules based on their sequences remains an important challenge in bioinformatics. When modeling biological sequences using traditional sequencing models, long-range interaction, complicated and variable output of labeled structures, and variable length of biological sequences usually lead to different solutions on a case-by-case basis. This study proposed a unified deep learning architecture based on long short-term memory or a gated recurrent unit to capture long-range interactions. The architecture designs the optional reshape operator to adapt to the diversity of the output labels and implements a training algorithm to support the training of sequence models capable of processing variable-length sequences. The merging and pooling operators enhances the ability of capturing short-range interactions between basic units of biological sequences. The proposed deep-learning architecture and its training algorithm might be capable of solving currently variable biological sequence-modeling problems under a unified framework. We validated the model on one of the most difficult biological sequence-modeling problems, protein residue interaction prediction. The results indicate that the accuracy of obtaining the residue interactions of the model exceeded popular approaches by 10 percent on multiple widely-used benchmarks.},
