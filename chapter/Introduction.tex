\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:Motivation}

The prediction of pesticide degradation has gained significant attention due to its environmental and health impacts. Traditional methods for determining the degradation of pesticides by enzymes are laborintensive and time-consuming, necessitating the development of efficient computational methods. Pesticides, used globally for crop protection, often persist in the environment, posing risks to ecosystems and human health. Enzymes, as biological catalysts, play a crucial role in breaking down these pesticides into less harmful substances. This enzymatic degradation is essential for reducing the environmental toxicity of pesticides.

Recent advancements in DNA and RNA sequencing technologies have expanded the understanding of enzyme functions. Leveraging this wealth of data through computational methodologies, particularly Deep Learning, offers a promising approach to predicting enzymemediated pesticide degradation. Successful applications of Deep Learning in genomics and environmental science suggest its potential in enhancing pesticide degradation predictions, which is vital for developing sustainable agricultural products.

Especially in the context of discovering previously unknown enzymes and their functions, Deep Learning models can provide valuable insights into enzyme classification and behavior. By accurately predicting enzyme classes responsible for pesticide degradation, these models can facilitate the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable agricultural practices. The ability to predict enzyme functions with high accuracy and resolution is crucial for understanding the complex interactions between enzymes and pesticides, enabling the design of effective bioremediation strategies.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:Problem Statement}

Despite significant advancements in bioinformatics and computational biology, predicting enzyme classes involved in pesticide degradation remains challenging. Most of the traditional methods depend mainly on experimental data, which is time-consuming and high costly in most cases. Moreover, the functions of enzymes are very diverse and complex, as well as their interaction with different kinds of substrates, which further complicates the prediction process. Additionally, in some cases, the existing computational models have shown low prediction accuracies. This thesis puts forward an innovative Deep Learning model that employs predictions of enzyme binding sites to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of enzyme class prediction. The approach is focused on critical interaction regions, with the goal of outperforming state-of-the-art models and providing a strong tool for computational biology and environmental science. In particular, this research aims to:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Develop a \textit{novel} Deep Learning architecture that targets the ligand-binding sites of enzymes to predict the enyzmatic function.
    \item Enhance the accuracy and resolution of enzyme class predictions, particularly at the most specific level of the Enzyme Commission (EC) hierarchy.
    \item Address the challenges associated with data imbalance and class representation in enzyme classification datasets.
\end{enumerate}
